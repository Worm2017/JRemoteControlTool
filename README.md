# JRemoteControlTool
This tool mostly designed to control your pcs on your local network at home, since there is currently no encryption provided.

I am looking forward to make sure the transfer of data will be secured.

The goal of this tool is to stay lightweight, therefore this tool is mostly using a terminal like control - for personal purposes to control a pc on your local network for example if you have to help a family member which is on 1st floor while you are sitting on the 2nd floor in front of your pc.

## Usage
This tool is still under development and yet there is no (usable/released) version available.

## Features
There a few things I'd like to support. A little overview:
* Easy file transfer
* Execute system commands (like cmd, notepad etc.) and other software
* Ability to capture web-cam screenshots and save them
* Client and server should be easy to update
* GUI and Terminal-like control
* Ability to Nmap the client
