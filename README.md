# JRemoteControlTool
This tool allows you to simply control your computers at home via external use or at home if you are too lazy to stand up to take a look what happened.

The goal of this tool is to stay lightweight, therefore this tool is mostly using a terminal like control.

## Usage
This tool is still under development and yet there is no (usable/released) version available.

## Features
There a few things I'd like to support. A little overview:
* Easy file transfer
* Execute system commands (like cmd, notepad etc.) and other software
* Ability to capture web-cam screenshots and save them
* Client and server should be easy to update
* GUI and Terminal-like control
* Ability to Nmap the client
